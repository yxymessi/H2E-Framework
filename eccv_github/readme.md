# Identifying Hard Noise in Long-Tailed Sample Distribution
This project introduces a new challenge as Noisy Long-Tailed Classification (NLT) and three NLT benchmarks: ImageNet-NLT, Animal10-NLT, and Food101-NLT. The proposed H2E together with other baselines are also included. This project is the official implementation of the ECCV 2022(oral) paper Identifying Hard Noise in Long-Tailed Sample Distribution.


The detailed instruction of creating benchmarks and other baselines are coming soon.

We will also release a clearer version of implementation of H2E with notes soon.
